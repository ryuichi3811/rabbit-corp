In the process, I have come to the conclusion that the 'mysteries' of the body can be solved if I can 'communicate' with the elements that make up a person - muscles, lymph, muscles, cells, bones and mind. For example, I first try to communicate (coordinate) with my gastrointestinal tract. This is because I believe that the gastrointestinal tract is an important entity that shows me the state of my body. I believe that the life force of a person is very strong and that even pain that lasts for decades can be remedied through correct communication. My aim is to help you get rid of your pain and help you smile and have a good time.",
